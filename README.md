Greetings and welcome to my repository, which is devoted to the activities and projects I'm working on during my internship in Python at Octanet. A range of Python scripts, notebooks, and projects that highlight my growing skill set and current difficulties may be found here.

An important first step on my path to becoming an expert in Python and its uses in automation, web development, data analysis, and other areas is this internship. By means of demanding practical assignments and guidance, I'm delving deeply into the potent libraries and frameworks of Python.


As I complete my internship, be sure to check back often for updates and take a look at what I've been working on in the repository!

Cheers to coding! üöÄ
